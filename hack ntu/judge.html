                <h1>JUDGING CRITERIA </h1>
                <h2>STEP 1</h2>
                <p>Hackers are required to submit their hacks onto the DevPost portal before the end of the hacking period. This is used by the judges in the next step to catch a glimpse into your idea beforehand. Hackers can view and edit their submissions till the end of the hacking period.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>STEP 2 </h2>
                <p>HackerFair - Participants will have 2 minutes to present their solutions as creatively as possible and engage with the judges. Part of developing a successful hack is winning people over to use it! Judges assigned to each individual zone will shortlist 4 finalists to make the final 8.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>STEP 3 </h2>
                <p>The judges will then select the top 8 teams from the HackerFair, who will be given a chance to pitch for a total time of 3 minutes. The final decision will then be made.</p>
